# **Trailing Hearts Animation** 💖  

🚀 **Live Demo**: [View Project](https://isaacsemb.github.io/p30-001-trailing-hearts/)  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **JavaScript-based trailing hearts animation** that follows the user's cursor, creating a smooth and visually appealing effect. The goal was to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and CSS animations while ensuring **efficient performance** and a polished **user experience**.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Smooth Animation** – Hearts float up and fade out naturally.  
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Uses `requestAnimationFrame` and removes elements after animation.  
✅ **Dynamic Sizing & Colors** – Hearts appear in random sizes and colors for variety.  
✅ **CSS Keyframe Animation** – Creates a realistic floating effect.  
✅ **No Interference** – Hearts don't block user interactions (`pointer-events: none`).  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML5** – Structuring the web page.  
- **CSS3** – Keyframe animations and styling.  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation and event handling.  


## **Setup & Installation**  
1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trailing-hearts-animation.git
   ```

## **Future Improvements**  
🔹 Add a toggle button to enable/disable hearts.  
🔹 Implement different shapes (stars, sparkles, etc.).  
🔹 Optimize for mobile touch events.
